This is my second project. In my first project, [An Arithmetic Arranger](https://github.com/wswalker87/fcc_arithmetic_arranger) I used a lot of inline comments. These are meant for me as I get further into my python learning. With this second project I will keeping more comments in this README.

I **understand** that is not necessarily the purpose of this file, but it is **_MY_** project and I intend to use it to work more in markdown as well as keep my hurdles listed as a kind of ~~Wow, look at everything I messed up.~~ look how far I've come!
